# This is a function/method we define it using the 'def' keyword 
# and the name of it after with brackets.
# Functions can give an output. 
# If we want to return as an output something we can use the 'return' keyword 
# and the output prosiding it. Example: return 5 # will return the number 5 as an output
# here the speak function should return the string "Ahoy matey"
# if you want to make sure this function is call you may use the 'print' keyword


# in the next chapter I explain what is the perpose of the '-> str'
